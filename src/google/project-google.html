      <p>Class Cards is my submission for the Google Interaction Design exercise. I chose to do the ‘Names and Faces’ prompt, the purpose of which is to ‘design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the goal of shortening the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy.’</p>

      <h3 class="box">Research</h3>
      <p>I started work by thinking about the users (teachers) and the kinds of environments in which they might use this tool. Schools can be rich or poor. Students can stay in one classroom all day, or they can move around every period. Classes can be held in school rooms with desks, or they can be hands-on in a lab setting or out in the field. Although there’s a lot of variation in class size, style, and student age range possible, the main differentiator between them seems to be whether teachers stay with one class all day or teach multiple classes in periods.</p>

      <p>If teachers teach a single class, they have a limited number of names and faces to remember, but if they teach many, there could be quite a lot. How many students are typically in a class, and how many classes might be taught in a typical day? I did a quick search and found that <a class="a-text" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass1112_2013314_t1s_007.asp">30 students</a> is a good high estimate for an average American class size, and school days can have up to about <a class="a-text" href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-classes-does-an-American-high-school-student-usually-have-in-a-day">eight</a> <a class="a-text" href="https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/high-school-life/38419-what-how-many-periods-does-your-school-have.html">periods</a>. So a teacher with a full class every period could be on the hook for learning about 240 names in 30-student chunks every term. I also picked up a little vocabulary: the single-classroom model is called ‘self-contained’, and the multiple-period model is called ‘departmentalized’.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Application Flow</h3>
      <p>After sketching the general flow, I made a quick diagram to keep track of the various cases and adjusted it as my overall thinking evolved. The first decision was trying to figure out how the moon travelers should be selected — should it be a contest, or should the trip be invite-only? I finally landed on a contest for two reasons: one, the more people who could see it, the more marketing value it would have for the business, and two, the more people who could apply, the easier it would probably be to get the right number of winners and alternates. A small group of top Etsy sellers, for example, might not overlap much with a group of people interested in flying to the moon, so a bigger pool of applicants would be better for making sure the spaceship was full.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Screen Design</h3>

      <p>Once I knew what I wanted to show, flow-wise, I moved on to designing the screens. I spent a lot of time looking at Etsy marketing pages, in order to build up a visual vocabulary, and also to look for existing patterns to hold my content. Then I focused on the application form, where I decided to disable the submit button until all the fields were complete so I could limit validation to the fields with specific requirements. I tried to jazz things up with a few space illustrations in the Etsy style, but it’s harder than it looks to draw them convincingly. It was also about this time that the body font changed, so I spent some time updating to Graphik Web. <a href="img/etsy_screens.zip" class="merriweather">Download screens (8MB)</a></p>

    <h3 class="box">HTML Mockup</h3>
    <p>Because I know product designers write front-end code at Etsy, I thought it would also be a good idea to try building <a class="merriweather" href="moon/moon_marketing.html">the moon marketing page</a>. I used a combination of Etsy’s styles and HTML/CSS of my own to build it, as well as screenshots of a typical header and footer to save a little time. If I’d had more time available, I would have liked to explore a little rocketship animation on scroll, and maybe some rollover animations on the illustrations. I would have also made the page responsive, as this version only works on desktop web.</p>
