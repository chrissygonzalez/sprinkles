      <h1 class="projecth1">QuickBooks Mobile First-time Use Experience</h1>
      <p>A few months after I started working on the QuickBooks Mobile Android app, I got the chance to redesign the signed-out experience. There hadn't been a designer on the project for most of the time it was in development, so no one had ever really considered what it was like for new users to download the app, try to sign in, and poke around to see what it did. We'd been so focused on what went on after sign-in, we didn't realize how many customers were getting confused and giving up.</p>

      <img class="hero" src="http://placehold.it/683x400">

      <h3 class="box">Is it stuck?</h3>

      <p>The redesign began with a proposal from one of our engineers: couldn't we do something better with our loading screen? Ours had a single message and a spinner, which spun until a user's often hefty data file downloaded. It also spun when something went wrong and the process got stuck, but there was no way to tell the difference. When I started to look more closely at the loading screen, I realized the sign in screen that came before it also could use improvement.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Secret Data</h3>

      <p>I wanted to propose turning the loading screen project into a bigger redesign that included sign in, so I grabbed our product manager after a meeting and drew it out. He was one step ahead of me with ideas I hadn't considered, and then revealed some interesting statistics: only 56-68% of people who downloaded our app had an account that let them use it. Everyone else who tried it out went away disappointed.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Wireframes</h3>

      <p>Once we had a general idea of what we wanted to accomplish – provide information to users without a QuickBooks account and make the sign-in process clearer and more successful for those who did – I started sketching. In my experience, this is sometimes a good way to fuel a conversation that's otherwise not a top priority, by giving team members something to react to.</p>

      <p>My first version didn't include any information on QuickBooks account requirements. I added it in the second round, but only as an illustration of how hopelessly complicated it was. The third version put that on hold for a moment and focused on features and tips to highlight. We actually revised what we called Get an Account a few more times, based on feedback from other product groups, until it was as simple as it could be without overhauling the way we sold the product (although we tried that, too).</p>

      <p>Perhaps our biggest victory was getting a single phone number for customers to call for help, instead of one for each type of QuickBooks you might have. Calling for help was less desirable than being able to self-serve through the app, but it was our best available option for a complex product line-up.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Visual Design</h3>

      <p>I thought the signed-out part of the app should behave something like the box software used to come in – it should be a little shiny and provide some, but not too much, information. There was no defined QuickBooks brand at the time, so I pulled colors and type from the larger Intuit brand and then added texture and a little depth for visual appeal. In retrospect, using a non-system font for button labels created an amazing amount of unnecessary production work, but I was happy with the way it looked at the time.</p>

      <h3 class="box">The Launch</h3>

      <p>As the first big UI story I designed for the app, this turned out to be one of the most successful. We had clear metrics going into it, so we were able to see the impact it had after a few months. Log in errors went down by 21%, which meant users were entering the right credentials more often or trying the wrong credentials less often. We also increased engagement with the app before sign in by 25%. And by adding a way to sign up for a QuickBooks Online trial directly in the app, we actually increased trial sign ups from any source by 50%.</p>
