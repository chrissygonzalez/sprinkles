      <p>As part of Etsy product designer application process, I created this marketing page and associated application form to invite Etsy users to travel to the moon. The brief: “Etsy wants to celebrate its 10th anniversary by giving away a trip to the Moon to selected users. Design a web marketing page that users can sign up to go to the moon.” My design process involved sketches, a flow, visual design, and an HTML mockup of the main page.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Sketches</h3>
      <p>I usually start by considering the problem and sketching out my thoughts. For the moon trip, I had an initial idea of how it should work (marketing page, sign up form, feedback on successful submission, etc.), so I drew it out and added more pieces to the core flow as I thought of them. I spent some time considering what information a potential applicant might need from the marketing page (why the moon? how will we get there?), and also ideas for how to make it special (maybe interesting moon-themed content). Later, when I’d decided what screens I wanted to show, I sketched out the flow again and used it as a checklist to make sure everything was covered.</p>

    </figure>
    <p class="caption">Initial sketches of the flow and a later checklist to keep track of progress</p>

      <h3 class="box">Application Flow</h3>
      <p>After sketching the general flow, I made a quick diagram to keep track of the various cases and adjusted it as my overall thinking evolved. The first decision was trying to figure out how the moon travelers should be selected — should it be a contest, or should the trip be invite-only? I finally landed on a contest for two reasons: one, the more people who could see it, the more marketing value it would have for the business, and two, the more people who could apply, the easier it would probably be to get the right number of winners and alternates. A small group of top Etsy sellers, for example, might not overlap much with a group of people interested in flying to the moon, so a bigger pool of applicants would be better for making sure the spaceship was full.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Screen Design</h3>

      <p>Once I knew what I wanted to show, flow-wise, I moved on to designing the screens. I spent a lot of time looking at Etsy marketing pages, in order to build up a visual vocabulary, and also to look for existing patterns to hold my content. Then I focused on the application form, where I decided to disable the submit button until all the fields were complete so I could limit validation to the fields with specific requirements. I tried to jazz things up with a few space illustrations in the Etsy style, but it’s harder than it looks to draw them convincingly. It was also about this time that the body font changed, so I spent some time updating to Graphik Web. <a href="img/etsy_screens.zip" class="merriweather">Download screens (8MB)</a></p>

    <h3 class="box">HTML Mockup</h3>
    <p>Because I know product designers write front-end code at Etsy, I thought it would also be a good idea to try building <a class="merriweather" href="moon/moon_marketing.html">the moon marketing page</a>. I used a combination of Etsy’s styles and HTML/CSS of my own to build it, as well as screenshots of a typical header and footer to save a little time. If I’d had more time available, I would have liked to explore a little rocketship animation on scroll, and maybe some rollover animations on the illustrations. I would have also made the page responsive, as this version only works on desktop web.</p>
