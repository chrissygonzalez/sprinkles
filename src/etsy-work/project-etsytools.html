		 <p>At Etsy, I was a product designer on the Internal Platforms team, where we built and maintained the internal tools Etsy employees used to do their jobs. Most of the work we did was in service of either marketing or member and marketplace support, because those two teams often needed tooling but didn’t have the resources to build their own.</p>

		 <p>Many teams at Etsy produce content that highlights specific items or sellers as part of their daily work. Every seller being considered for a feature is reviewed by a small team of marketplace experts, but the review process was slow and full of cumbersome workarounds. From September 2016 to April 2017, I worked on a set of tools to make reviewing shops and finding already reviewed shops easier, faster, and more efficient.</p>

		<p>The Marketing Site Builder project was a collaboration between the Design Systems team and Internal Platforms, with Design Systems in charge of defining marketing design patterns and Internal Platforms tasked with designing and building the actual tool. In research I uncovered unexpected stakeholders and translation workflows and helped narrow project scope, but the project was cancelled before I was able to start testing design solutions.</p>
