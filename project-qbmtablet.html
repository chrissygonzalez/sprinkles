      <p>While working on QuickBooks Mobile for Android, a phone-sized companion for QuickBooks, we noticed a surprising number of users downloading and using the app on tablets. We hadn’t really designed it to be used that way — Android scales the screens, but it’s still a pretty terrible experience — so we made a business case for building a tablet-optimized UI. Building an entirely different app for tablet wasn’t an option, so the first challenge was figuring out if refactoring the phone app was even going to be possible.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Experiments</h3>

      <p>For the first few months, the tablet development team was limited to a single engineer. Her job was to figure out if we'd need to start from scratch, or whether the existing code could somehow be refactored for a larger display. I worked with her to produce demos that eventually earned us the green light — they didn't look great, but they proved that our code could be made modular and would adapt to larger screens.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Early Wireframes</h3>

      <p>Once engineering gave the go-ahead, we were suddenly given a full team of developers who were ready to build. It was early in the design process, but I had done some initial wireframe explorations, so I shared them with the larger team. This quickly exposed strongly-held opinions within the group.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Brainstorm</h3>

      <p>I was getting a lot of conflicting feedback from different members of the team, so after going through a few cycles of revisions, I pulled everyone into a room and had them voice their concerns in person. This was a great way to get some questions answered, but as an unexpected benefit, it also started to change the team dynamic (for the better).</p>

      <h3 class="box">Visual Design</h3>

      <p>After the first few months, we started working with an agency for interaction design, so I was able to focus on visual design. For the first release to alpha testers, I designed representative screens for all the major sections of the app and documented the styles I was using in a very rough style guide. I also produced the initial image assets for the different densities that seemed appropriate. At the same time, I was working on what the future releases would look like once we added more features.</p>

      <h3 class="box">Additional Features And Views</h3>

      <p>In the next releases, we built on what went out in the alpha version and tested new ideas for search and adding information on the fly. We added a grid view for transactions and also tried some things that didn't work and were scrapped. As we got closer to the beta release, we introduced the action bar to the phone and added a sliding navigation drawer to both phone and tablet. When the Kindle Fire and the Nexus 7 came out, I had to readjust my workflow to design for smaller tablets, especially for some of the transaction forms with a lot of fields.</p>

      <p>At the very end, we focused on polish. Everything that didn't make the cut was slated for the next version… but then the company decided to move work on the app to India, and we lost our chance.</p>
